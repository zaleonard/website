                <p className="hero--section--description">I am 33 years old and grew up just outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry, and I recently obtained certifications in data science from Datacamp.com and AZ-900 Azure fundamentals from Microsoft. </p>
                <p className="hero--section--description">I currently live in San Diego, California with my wife and son, Alicia and Zane.  Outside of my career, I love to cook and take my family on adventures around the city.  I am a massive Philadelphia sports fan, GO BIRDS!!  I am a life long gamer, and recently picked back up on a few nostalgic games such as old school runscape and Magic the gathering.</p>
